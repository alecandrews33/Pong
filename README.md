# Pong
Pong implementation written in Python and run in SDL


Dependencies:

-PySDL2

-pysdl2-dll

-traitsui (and a GUI backend: e.g PyQt5, wxPython, or PySide2)

(all available on PyPi)



On mac run:

    defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
    
(prevents option to select accents from coming up when you hold down a key)




Good options for next steps:

1) add dashed line in middle for aesthetic (no collisions)

2) allow paddles to move horizontally

3) fix the delay after a score

4) make the score render on the screen (the pong tutorial gives a brief 
suggestion on how to do this) and not print to the command line





?) train the Pong Master AI
